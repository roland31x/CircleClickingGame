### Bootleg Osu! map emulator

Needed to learn async programming, decided to use this project, it basically takes any osu! map and lets you play it, even shows a score window at the end.

It works for both keyboard (bindable) buttons and mouse buttons.

It has a base resolution but can switch to fullscreen in the options.

It has an option to select your osu! maps folder since the beatmap selection has a default path ( which includes 5 default maps ) but this default path can be overriden using this option.

It runs fairly well, I wanted to give more attention to this project but stuff just gets complicated and didn't feel like pushing it further.


App tries to reflect all of osu! no-mod gameplay mechanics ( apart from spinners which i didn't implement yet ).
